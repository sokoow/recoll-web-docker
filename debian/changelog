  * 1.19.14 fixes two relatively minor but ennoying issues in indexing:

   - The use of a separate readonly Database object for querying the index
     while indexing would trigger Xapian errors, (bad block reads), and
     subsequent up-to-date check failures (leading to unnecessary
     reindexing). The jury is out as to the cause, but using the same
     object for reading and writing seems to eliminate the problem.

   - A spurious log message in the child process between forking and
     executing the filter could block on a mutex, and lead to a 20 mn
     timeout for the affected father process thread (happened only in
     multithread mode).
